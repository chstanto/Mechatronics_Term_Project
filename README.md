# Mechatronics_Term_Project
This repository contains source code and documentation for my ME 405 portfolio. Coding for all labs was done in Python and documentation was generated using Doxygen.

Included is documentation for the term project, the objective of which was to
balance a small rubber ball on top of a platform capable of rotating about two axis. The system included two DC motors along with two encoders which allowed for control of the platforms motion. The ball's position and velocity were determined using a resistive touch panel on top of the platform.

All documentation for the term project as well as preliminary labs can be seen at https://chstanto.github.io/Mechatronics_Term_Project/ .
