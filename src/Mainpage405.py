@section sec_intro Introduction
    This website displays completed projects from ME405: Mechatronics.

@section sec_Lab_1 Lab 1: Vendotron
    The objective of this lab was to simulate a virtual vending machine able
    to accept user input and calculate virtual change.
    Please see Lab_01.py for more details.
    
@section sec_Lab_2 Lab 2: Think Fast!
    The objective of this lab was to make use of an external interrupt to 
    develop a basic reaction time game run on the Nucleo.
    Please see Lab_02.py for more details.

@section sec_Lab_3 Lab 3: Pushing the Right Buttons
    The objective of this lab was to make use of the serial communication
    between the Nucleo and Spyder to record, send, and plot ADC data.
    Please see Lab_03_Front.py and Lab_03_Back.py for more details.
    
@section sec_Lab_4 Lab 4: Hot or Not?
    The objective of this lab was to develop a driver for the MCP9808 temperature
    sensor and compare its data to that of the Nucleo's on-board sensor.
    Please see Lab_04_Main.py and mcp9808.py for more details about this lab.
    
@section sec_Lab_7 Lab 7: Feeling Touchy
    The objective of this lab was to develop a driver to manage the touch
    panel used in the term project. For mor information about the driver
    please see Touch_Panel_Driver.py along with the Touch_Panel_Driver class.

@section sec_Lab_8 Lab 8: Term Project Part 1
    The objective of this lab was to develop motor and encoder drivers to aid
    in the term project. For more information about this lab please see 
    Motor_Driver.py and Encoder_Driver.py along with the corresponding
    Motor_Driver class and Encoder_Driver class.
    
@section sec_Lab_9 Lab 9: Term Project Part 2
    The objective of this lab was to complete the term project by adding closed
    loop control to the platform and ball system. For more information on this
    lab see PB_FSM.py along with P_Controller and PB_Controller classes.
    Video evidence of platform control can be seen at https://bit.ly/3qVk4E3 .
