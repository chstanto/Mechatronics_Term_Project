@page       - Balance Table System Modeling

@brief      The objective of this lab was to model the physical system.

@details    The physical balancing table system was modeled in this lab
            as shown by the images below. Many approximations were made to
            simplify the math, but the result should provide a sufficient
            model to which a controller can be applied.
