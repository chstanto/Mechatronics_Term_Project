\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file manages the communication between the mcp9808 sensor and the board. 

This file acts as a driver for the mcp9808 temperature sensor. The driver uses I2C communication to read the ambient temperature register stored on the mcp9808 module, and interprets it into temperatures in both celsius and fahrenheit.
