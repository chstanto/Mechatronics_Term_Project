This website displays completed projects from M\+E405\+: Mechatronics.\hypertarget{index_sec_Lab_1}{}\doxysection{Lab 1\+: Vendotron}\label{index_sec_Lab_1}
The objective of this lab was to simulate a virtual vending machine able to accept user input and calculate virtual change. Please see \mbox{\hyperlink{Lab__01_8py}{Lab\+\_\+01.\+py}} for more details.\hypertarget{index_sec_Lab_2}{}\doxysection{Lab 2\+: Think Fast!}\label{index_sec_Lab_2}
The objective of this lab was to make use of an external interrupt to develop a basic reaction time game run on the Nucleo. Please see \mbox{\hyperlink{Lab__02_8py}{Lab\+\_\+02.\+py}} for more details.\hypertarget{index_sec_Lab_3}{}\doxysection{Lab 3\+: Pushing the Right Buttons}\label{index_sec_Lab_3}
The objective of this lab was to make use of the serial communication between the Nucleo and Spyder to record, send, and plot A\+DC data. Please see \mbox{\hyperlink{Lab__03__Front_8py}{Lab\+\_\+03\+\_\+\+Front.\+py}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{Lab__03__Back_8py}{Lab\+\_\+03\+\_\+\+Back.\+py}} for more details.\hypertarget{index_sec_Lab_4}{}\doxysection{Lab 4\+: Hot or Not?}\label{index_sec_Lab_4}
The objective of this lab was to develop a driver for the M\+C\+P9808 temperature sensor and compare its data to that of the Nucleo\textquotesingle{}s on-\/board sensor. Please see \mbox{\hyperlink{Lab__04__Main_8py}{Lab\+\_\+04\+\_\+\+Main.\+py}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{mcp9808_8py}{mcp9808.\+py}} for more details about this lab.\hypertarget{index_sec_Lab_7}{}\doxysection{Lab 7\+: Feeling Touchy}\label{index_sec_Lab_7}
The objective of this lab was to develop a driver to manage the touch panel used in the term project. For mor information about the driver please see \mbox{\hyperlink{Touch__Panel__Driver_8py}{Touch\+\_\+\+Panel\+\_\+\+Driver.\+py}} along with the Touch\+\_\+\+Panel\+\_\+\+Driver class.\hypertarget{index_sec_Lab_8}{}\doxysection{Lab 8\+: Term Project Part 1}\label{index_sec_Lab_8}
The objective of this lab was to develop motor and encoder drivers to aid in the term project. For more information about this lab please see \mbox{\hyperlink{Motor__Driver_8py}{Motor\+\_\+\+Driver.\+py}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{Encoder__Driver_8py}{Encoder\+\_\+\+Driver.\+py}} along with the corresponding Motor\+\_\+\+Driver class and Encoder\+\_\+\+Driver class.\hypertarget{index_sec_Lab_9}{}\doxysection{Lab 9\+: Term Project Part 2}\label{index_sec_Lab_9}
The objective of this lab was to complete the term project by adding closed loop control to the platform and ball system. For more information on this lab see \mbox{\hyperlink{PB__FSM_8py}{P\+B\+\_\+\+F\+S\+M.\+py}} along with P\+\_\+\+Controller and P\+B\+\_\+\+Controller classes.
