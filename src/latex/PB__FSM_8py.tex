\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file defines the platform and ball finite state machine. 

This file sets up the platform and ball finite state machine used to balance the ball on the platform. At the bottom of the file is test code which runs the finite state machine at a frequency of 20 Hz. The following link contains video of the system performance with a brief explanation of its functions. \href{https://bit.ly/3qVk4E3}{\texttt{ https\+://bit.\+ly/3q\+Vk4\+E3}}



The plot above shows the simulation results for the platform only when gains were calculated using a percent overshoot of 0.\+075 and a settling time of 0.\+25 seconds. The resulting gains were as follows K1 = -\/0.\+05, K2 = -\/1.\+22.



The plot above shows the simulation results for the platform and ball system when gains were calculated using a percent overshoot of 0.\+075 and a settling time of 3 seconds. The resulting gains were as K1 = -\/0.\+15, K2 = -\/0.\+05, K3 = -\/0.\+36, K4 = -\/0.\+55.
